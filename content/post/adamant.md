My secret soul that hides between  
What parts of my world count as seen  
Is sometimes moved  
And sometimes bruised  
And one day it may die.  
  
All the words I ever knew  
Won't give it away to you  
It sometimes screams  
And sometimes dreams  
And does it all alone.  
  
It holds within an ageless ache  
Because, you see, it cannot break.  
It sometimes sleeps  
And else, it weeps.  
I feel it in my bones.  
  
Kiss me, I may say, and hope  
You'll draw it out upon a rope  
You lower through  
What's told as true  
And taste it where it lies.
