We die; we are killed, we are weathered, are felled, are decayed,  
We remain living, watching the ghosts that our murders have made  
We suffer our punishments at unseen, untouchable hands;  
We write our poetry in languages no one else understands.  
  
I look at you, and my mind is unbound, unfettered in storm  
Undoing ghost, what were the murders that made such a form?  
I write myself over once more for your unseeing eye,  
I look at you, self-written cryptic, and suffer, and die.
