The covert coming into sight  
The slip of dark away from light  
The words rethought, rethought, unsaid  
The song of tools whose hands are dead  
The tree that never fell at all  
The tree that is about to fall  
The site of work not yet begun  
The shape of work that can't be done  
Go forth, and train your secret ear  
And silence will be all you hear.
