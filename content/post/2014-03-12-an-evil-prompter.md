Who is the person holding the cue cards  
and what does he want today?  
Sleep ran off with Night, so I drank with First Light  
She washed all my lines away  
Sometimes they're blank, and sometimes they're written  
in languages I never learned  
Sometimes he's filled them with absolute nonsense  
And sometimes he's holding them turned  
  
Who is the person holding the cue cards  
and what does he want with me?  
We've never met, and we've never spoken  
So why can't he leave me be?  
Everyone sees him, but don't seem to notice  
It's me that they're looking at funny  
Is he Somebody's nephew or Somebody's boyfriend?  
Is Somebody taking his Money?  
  
It's driving me to my limit  
It's time to get out of this business  
I fail to see what's in it  
For me anymore  
  
Wave me goodbye and kiss me  
Lie to my face that you'll miss me  
As you were, I'm sure you're busy  
I know the way to the door
