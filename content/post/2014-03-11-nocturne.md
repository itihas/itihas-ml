Long did I travel, from home I was far  
When I saw you make love to the evening star  
That home I've forgotten, and can't find anew  
For my world has faded to that star and you.  
  
Venus is fickle, but her lovers are true  
You've yet to return from wherever you flew.  
I'll shadow herâ€”though she seems dark to me too  
I'll wait in her darkness to once more see you.
