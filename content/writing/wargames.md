Smoke and the burn and the restless mad turn  
Of the wheels in my head that all churn out cliches that I somehow don't mind and I somehow don't pause  
And a million and one stupid thoughts without cause  
And the cleverness I somehow catch when they're listening  
And foolishness inside my safe simple mind  
And rhymes that need use of the useless word glistening and all of the pretty young thoughts I can find  
And I wish I could dredge up my histories in ways  
That make them anew for me, not just them  
Who will sometimes sit down and hear what I say  
And I really do try to entertain where I can  
And my reader you see, hasn't found herself yet  
And my reader, she hasn't found me, but she's looking  
And while she looks, foolisher rhymes will keep cooking  
And words are invented, and rearranged more  
For the pleasure of war games than the business of war.
