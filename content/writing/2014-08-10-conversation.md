<span style="font-size: small;"><span
style="font-family: inherit;">“Conversations always end too soon for
me.”</span></span>

<span style="font-size: small;"><span
style="font-family: inherit;"></span></span>

<span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">“Do
they now.”</span></span>

<span style="font-size: small;"><span
style="font-family: inherit;"></span></span>

<span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">I
chewed on my lip, trying to frame my answer. “Either it's awesome, it's
working, and the other person says it's over out of the blue, or it just
peters off, and I don't know where it went.” No, that wasn't right.
“It's not that they're silent, more that it stops working like it
was.”</span></span>

<span style="font-size: small;"><span
style="font-family: inherit;"></span></span>

<span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">He
seemed perfectly content to stand where he was, looking at me or through
me as we went on. “You make it sound like a machine.”</span></span>

<span style="font-size: small;"><span
style="font-family: inherit;"></span></span>

<span style="font-size: small;"><span
style="font-family: inherit;">“Conversations? Yeah. Lots of delicate
little bits that go in very specific places.”</span></span>

<span style="font-size: small;"><span
style="font-family: inherit;"></span></span>

<span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">“And
a lot to get wrong.”</span></span>

<span style="font-size: small;"><span
style="font-family: inherit;"></span></span>

<span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">I
twisted a corner of my mouth. “Yeah. That's where the problem is. It's
like everybody I talk to works with only half the blueprint I've
got.”</span></span>

<span style="font-size: small;"><span
style="font-family: inherit;"></span></span>

<span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">The
damp seeped into our clothes as the mist curled. Fingers of it licked at
his ears. He rubbed his jaw, and I followed the motions of his white,
smooth hands. “What is it supposed to accomplish? This machine of
yours?”</span></span>

<span style="font-size: small;"><span
style="font-family: inherit;"></span></span>

<span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">I
blinked, and pinched a slip of tissue from behind my lip between my
tongue and teeth. “I don't know.”</span></span>

<span style="font-size: small;"><span
style="font-family: inherit;"></span></span>

<span style="font-size: small;"><span
style="font-family: inherit;">“Well, that's an easy
answer.”</span></span>

<span style="font-size: small;"><span
style="font-family: inherit;"></span></span>

<span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">“If
I don't know, that's it, isn't it?”</span></span>

<span style="font-size: small;"><span
style="font-family: inherit;"></span></span>

<span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">He
shifted to face me better. He'd been alternating between this and facing
the street to my left for the past half hour, always leaning against the
waist-high fence I was sitting on. “It doesn't explain why you keep
trying to build it.”</span></span>

<span style="font-size: small;"><span
style="font-family: inherit;"></span></span>

<span style="font-size: small;"><span
style="font-family: inherit;">“Maybe I'm just curious.”</span></span>

<span style="font-size: small;"><span
style="font-family: inherit;"></span></span>

<span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">“Oh,
come now.” He was smirking, but he was serious. “That's not an
acceptable answer.”</span></span>

<span style="font-size: small;"><span
style="font-family: inherit;"></span></span>

<span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">I
sighed. “No, it isn't.”</span></span>

<span style="font-size: small;"><span
style="font-family: inherit;"></span></span>

<span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">He
let me be silent, trying to think it through.</span></span>

<span style="font-size: small;"><span
style="font-family: inherit;"></span></span>

<span style="font-size: small;"><span
style="font-family: inherit;">“Maybe it is. Say I find a way to build
the whole thing – someone with the whole blueprint I have Or enough to
bullshit the rest of their way. Then I'll have finished, and I'll see
what it means, right? That's what I want.”</span></span>

<span style="font-size: small;"><span
style="font-family: inherit;"></span></span>

<span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">I
looked at him, and he had his own moment to chew that over. Then he
grinned. “I just hate the word. 'Curiosity'. It sounds so flimsy.
Compare it with someone saying, 'I want to *know*<span
style="font-style: normal;">.'”He'd lost the grin at the last, and put
it back with practiced timing. “They don't seem like the same
thing.”</span></span></span>

<span style="font-size: small;"><span
style="font-family: inherit;"></span></span>

<span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">I
was nodding along. “The second is more powerful. As though it could
shake your bones.”</span></span>

<span style="font-size: small;"><span
style="font-family: inherit;"></span></span>

<span style="font-size: small;"><span
style="font-family: inherit;">“Split them and eat the marrow.” He
laughed, falling back on the fence to face the street again. I smiled,
and looked down.</span></span>

<span style="font-size: small;"><span
style="font-family: inherit;"></span></span>

<span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">When
I looked up again, he was watching me, and the pause had stretched too
long.</span></span>

<span style="font-size: small;"><span
style="font-family: inherit;"></span></span>

<span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">I
didn't try to break it.</span></span>

<span style="font-size: small;"><span
style="font-family: inherit;"></span></span>

<span style="font-size: small;"><span
style="font-family: inherit;">Somehow, he found the moment, and spoke
again. “Maybe this is the solution to your problem.” He stopped, and
looked at me. I couldn't open my mouth – it had been glued shut from
being kept too long committed to staying that way. He smiled as if he
knew the issue. “How about I stick around until you want me to leave. We
don't have to say anything.”</span></span>

<span style="font-size: small;"><span
style="font-family: inherit;"></span></span>

<span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">When
I could, I said, “You don't have to do that.” My voice, nervous, was too
soft, and I had to repeat myself.</span></span>

<span style="font-size: small;"><span
style="font-family: inherit;"></span></span>

<span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">He
rubbed his jaw again. There were red spots on his hands, behind his
knuckles, between his tendons. It bought him a moment or two to consider
what he said.</span></span>

<span style="font-size: small;"><span
style="font-family: inherit;"></span></span>

<span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">“I'm
reasonably certain I want to. I'm not done with this yet.”</span></span>

<span style="font-size: small;"><span
style="font-family: inherit;"></span></span>

<span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Damp
made his hair heavy, and it was beginning to drip onto his
forehead.</span></span>

<span style="font-size: small;"><span
style="font-family: inherit;"></span></span>

<span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">I
hopped off the fence, and stretched forward with my hands still on it.
Then I turned, and jerked my head to my right.</span></span>

<span style="font-size: small;"><span
style="font-family: inherit;"></span></span>

<span style="font-size: small;"><span
style="font-family: inherit;">“Come on, let's go inside. We'll get a
cold.”</span></span>

<span style="font-size: small;"><span
style="font-family: inherit;"></span></span>

<span style="font-size: small;"><span
style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-style: normal;">He
lifted a corner of his mouth. “Why not. You have </span><span
style="font-style: normal;">hot </span><span
style="font-style: normal;">chocolate</span><span
style="font-style: normal;">?”</span></span></span>

<span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">
</span></span>
